          <p class="target1Explaination">Transportation contributes to harmful emissions, noise, and climate change.
            About 15% of the total greenhouse gases and 22% of the CO2 emissions are attributed to transportation.
            However, as vehicles are becoming more environmentally efficient, the global fleet of vehicles is increasing
            as well. An improvement of the footprint of transportation, especially the impacts of infrastructure
            construction and maintenance, is also a strategic goal to achieve. Transportation systems are also waste
            generators (vehicles, parts, packaging, etc.) that must be reduced, reused, and recycled.</p>

        <h3 class="solution1">Solution</h3>
        <p class="solution1Detail"><u>Solution1:</u> Decarbonizing Road Vehicles “Parking management is a crucial part
          of local authorities’ policy toolbox. It can make walking, cycling and public transport more attractive, and
          it can deliver a shift away from individual car ownership. Instead of individual car ownership, climate smart
          parking management can promote car sharing and ride sharing, so everyone can still access cars when they need
          to. This will require thinking differently about how space is allocated in our towns and cities.
          <br><u>Solution2:</u> improving public transits. Public transit systems are another way that cities are
          limiting greenhouse gases from vehicles. By investing in high-speed rails, electric bus networks, and
          modernized subways, cities are able to both improve efficiency and cut down on pollution.
          <br><u>Solution3:</u> Fewer cars equal fewer roads: More cars mean more roads need to be built, which causes
          water run-off that contributes to ground and water pollution. Fewer cars in favor of active transportation
          such as bikes mean more bike paths and lanes which are more sustainable.</br>
